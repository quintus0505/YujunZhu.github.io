For 2024, I'm working in the [Computational Behavior Lab](https://cbl.aalto.fi/) directed by [Prof. Antti Oulasvirta](https://users.aalto.fi/~oulasvir/) at Aalto University, Finland, advised by [Dr. Danqing Shi](https://sdq.github.io/). Currently, I am seeking a Ph.D. position in Robotics or Reinforcement Learning.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where I was supervised by [Prof. Jianmin Ji](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~jianmin/). I began my master's study in Human-Computer Interaction in 2022. In 2023, I had an exchange to EPFL as a robotics student.

Apart from research and work, I enjoy running and playing video games. In 2023, I participated in two half-marathons in Helsinki and Lausanne and "The" full marathon in Athens.
